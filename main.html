            <p class="subBio">
                &emsp;I am just a simple human who enjoys his life and  I will live my life to the fullest. I like breathtaking views especially in highland areas but ironically, I am also afraid of heights. While I travel, I also look for delivious eateries to recommend for my friends. I actually eat a <strong>LOT</strong> but I never get fat. People always ask me and they are wondering how am I not getting fat despite of eating a lot.
